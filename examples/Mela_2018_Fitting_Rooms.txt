MADHURI: Hmm... If I buy this, my husband will kill me.
LEENA: You are kidding. Right?
MADHURI: Ofcourse I don't mean that literally but he will not like it.
LEENA: Well, who cares about that! It is not like he makes you happy anyways. 
MADHURI: But can anyone really make anyone else happy?
LEENA: What do you mean?
MADHURI: One needs to keep oneself happy. Right?
LEENA: Good then, you found a good excuse to buy this dress. 
MADHURI: Well. I don't think you really care about\ what other men think of you. 
LEENA: Absolutely! 
MADHURI: How is that possible?
LEENA: I have a lot of other things to think about. 
MADHURI: Like what?
LEENA: Your marriage, our friend Pratima's marriage\ and all your marriages!
MADHURI: How does that work out for you?
LEENA: Well, I don't know.\ Between that and my career I don't have much time.
REEMA: Do you want to try this Mrs. Shah?
KANCHAN: Yes, Thank you.
REEMA: This color suits you very well.
KANCHAN: Are you sure? 
REEMA: Ofcourse, I am sure.
KANCHAN: How do you know? 
REEMA: How do I know?
KANCHAN: Yes. How do you know? 
REEMA: You are a winter.
KANCHAN: What?
REEMA: I mean your nature and your personality is like winter.\Very peaceful and like a saint.\On the other hand, I am a Summer... Very fierce...\So reds and yellows look good on me.\Hmm... for example this color looks good but not great on me.\Because this will bring out the "Greens" in me.\So I cannot wear it.\But you must because you are cold\Oh I mean winter-like
KANCHAN: Do you have this Sari in red or yellow?
REEMA: Ofcourse I do but not for you!
KANCHAN: OK then let me just try it out in green!
REEMA: Of course Madam. \I am enjoying this \You must be too... Right? 

MADHURI: I think I look like a Python in this dress.
LEENA: No. You look like an angel. 
MADHURI: But Girish will not like this dress.
LEENA: Girish.
MADHURI: My husband.
LEENA: But not your father
MADHURI: He will find this dress very tight.
LEENA: Is he going to punish you for that? 
MADHURI: It is easy for you to say this.
LEENA: Correct! 
MADHURI: But I am trying to do the right thing here.
LEENA: The issue at hand is not justice or morality...
but simply Polyester! 
MADHURI: What is wrong in aiming for a compromise in a marriage?
LEENA: But this is your wardrobe. 
MADHURI: But I am his wife.
LEENA: But this is your body.
MADHURI: But it is his credit card.
LEENA: But it is your signature.
MADHURI: Hmm... but it is so hard to decide what to wear. Right?
LEENA: See, it is quite natural for you to think\that wearing good clothes is\necessary to impress on people.\But the reality is that after looking at you once\people don't really pay attention to you.\So wear whatever the hell you please. 
MADHURI: Huh... that does not make me feel better.
LEENA: Is it my job to make you feel better? 
MADHURI: As my friend... of course it is.
LEENA: I see. So that is the purpose of friendship?
MADHURI: Not the only one... \but it is one of the several uses of friendship.
LEENA: But you never make me feel better.
MADHURI: Ah... But that  is not in my hands! 
LEENA: Somehow it is in my hands though! 
MADHURI: Yes
LEENA: But why is that? 
MADHURI: Because you are an independent person
LEENA: What? 
MADHURI: And I am dependent.
LEENA: OK 
MADHURI: You see... a dependent person cannot make an\independent one feel better.
LEENA: Then what really can a dependent person\make an independent one feel? 
MADHURI: You mean after the independent one makes \the dependent one feel better?
LEENA: Yes, What will the independent one get?
MADHURI: They will feel superior!
LEENA: I see. So if I make you feel better,\then I get to feel superior! 
MADHURI: That's right. You got it.
LEENA: Alright then, you don't look like a python! 
MADHURI: Ah see... Now I feel better already.\Now go tell that sales girl to get a smaller size.
