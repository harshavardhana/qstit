=====

**Software for live projection and manipulation of electronic subtitles (also called "surtitles", "supertitles", "soft-titles"...)**

Free software (GNU General Public Licence) developed by [Nova Cinema](http://www.nova-cinema.org) to project subtitles on top of a film image or on another screen. It can also be useful for various types of events and in many contexts. Qstit is fully configurable and can read plain text files (.txt) or SubRip files (.srt) with timecodes. The projection can be automated with SubRip files, Qstit can adapt the projection speed and resynchronize titles live in case of delay.
